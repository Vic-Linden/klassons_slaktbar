## School Project Overview

This project was developed as a group assignment to create a modern web presence for Klassons Slaktbar, a unique sports bar located in the historic Slakthusområdet, Stockholm.

The concept blends the cozy atmosphere of an Irish Pub-sports bars. The website is designed to be visually appealing, easy navigation, and fully responsive to meet the needs of sports fans and remote workers alike.
